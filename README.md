# NLP-TexasBlackout

An NLP analysis of the Texas blackout crisis on Twitter 

This code accompanies an academic study on the development of public perception during a crisis. The academic publication is titled: 

Finding public outrage on social media: the Texas blackouts


Abstract. In February 2021, Texas experienced three significant snowstorms that led to widespread rolling blackouts, impacting over 10 million people and resulting in estimated losses exceeding $155 billion. We propose a workflow to identify the factors that lead to public outrage in over 230,000 tweets using natural language processing (NLP). Through an automated emotional analysis, we find that people were angry due to the lack of transparent communication. The results show that people were willing to virally re-share the scarce information available about what was happening, even if it was bad news. A topic analysis discovers who were the main stakeholders in the public eye, and whether they were perceived as villains or allies. Our analysis finds precise moments of public outrage in the data, confirming the findings of a survey that found that 75% of respondents were outraged that Texas was not better prepared for the storm. We conclude that automated text data analytics can be used to detect and respond to public outrage in near real time, even if some human interpretation is still necessary to reach actionable conclusions. 


Notes about the code: 
1. In order to run the file called 'retrieve data' the user needs an academic X (formerly Twitter) licence. Note- The X API has changed in the past year, and this script may no longer work as expected. 
2. The text analysis is carried out in the file texastweetOpen.py
3. To enable use of the code, the input data retrieved from Twitter is provided in a variable called 'ercotall'. It is inclulded in this repository as a 'Git Large File' and therefore has to be pulled using 'git lfs pull'.
